<h4>1. What Is Section 8</h4>
<p>Created by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Section 8 refers to a section of federal subsidized housing. It aims to assist low-income families, disabled households as well as the elderly and afford them a clean and safe home in the private sector. You will be provided with a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) after being deemed eligible for the Section 8 program by your local Public Housing Authority (PHA). </p>
<h4>2. 4 Steps To Apply For Section 8 Online</h4>
<p>First, contact your  local PHA. This is the easiest and most direct way to find Section 8 housing. You can obtain a Section 8 housing choice voucher on the website of that Housing Authority. For the application, you can either fill it by hand or fill it out online.</p>
<p>Second, register for a waitlist. The online Section 8 housing application may require you to create a profile. You need to register your basic information such as name, email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Third, begin the initial application process. To identify the initial eligibility and confirm the identity of an applicant, you will be asked a series of questions such as: current address, family members, employment, income, additional contacts and value of assets. </p>
<p>Fourth, confirm your email address. Follow the instructions in your email to confirm your application. Remember to check your email for any updates.</p>
<h4>3. 4 Qualifications To Receive Section 8</h4>
<p>First, describe your type of household. According to HUD, a family is described as one or more persons who live together. It's worth noting that there is no blood relation required to be considered a family. Individual, single people and roommates can all be considered a family by HUD.</p>
<p>Second, report your financial status. Three basic levels are involved to determine applicant's income level:</p>
<p>Extremely low-income: Households that have an income level that is 30% of the area's median income levels. </p>
<p>Very Low-income: applicants whose income is 50% of the area's median income.</p>
<p>Low-income: applicants whose income equal  80% of the area's median income levels.</p>
<p>Third, verify your citizenship status. Only U.S. citizens or people who have eligible immigration status qualify for Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. </p>
<p>Fourth, describe your background, rental and criminal history. If any of your family member has one of the following records, you will be automatically disqualified:</p>
<p>Being convicted of drug related crimes and evicted from a property in the last 3 years</p>
<p>Being convicted of manufacturing methamphetamines in subsidized housing</p>
<p>Requiring a lifelong registration as a sex offender</p>
